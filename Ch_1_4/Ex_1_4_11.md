# 1.4.11

## Problem:

Add an instance method howMany() to StaticSETofInts (page 99) that finds the number of occurrences of a given key in time proportional to log N in the worst case.

## Solution：

find the minimum index key occurs in the array,
then find the maximum index.

```
if key is in the array
    the number of occurrences = max_index - min_index + 1
else
    the number of occurrences = 0
```

code:
