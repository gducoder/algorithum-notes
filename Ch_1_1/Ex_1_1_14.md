# 1.1.14

## 问题：

Write a static method lg() that takes an int value N as argument and returns the largest int not larger than the base-2 logarithm of N. Do not use Math.

## 分析：

Use while loop to keep dividing the argument by 2 (base was 2), till it reaches zero.

Keep a count on the number of times the division by 2 was been performed.

Return the count - 1 as the program wants the largest integer not larger than log value.
