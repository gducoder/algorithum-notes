# 1.1.29

## Question：

Equal keys. Add to BinarySearch a static method rank() that takes a key and a sorted array of int values (some of which may be equal) as arguments and returns the number of elements that are smaller than the key and a similar method count() that returns the number of elements equal to the key. Note : If i and j are the values returned by rank(key, a) and count(key, a) respectively, then a\[i..i+j-1\] are the values in the array that are equal to key.
