# 1.1.21

## 问题：

Write a program that reads in lines from standard input with each line contain-
ing a name and two integers and then uses printf() to print a table with a column of the names, the integers, and the result of dividing the first by the second, accurate to three decimal places. You could use a program like this to tabulate batting averages for baseball players or grades for students.
