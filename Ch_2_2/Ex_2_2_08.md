# 2.2.08

## Problem:

Suppose that ALGORITHM 2.4 is modified to skip the call on merge() whenever a[mid] <=a[mid+1].
Prove that the number of compares used to mergesort a sored array is linear.

## Solutionï¼š


```

N is equal to 2^n.

C(1) = 0
C(2) = 1
C(4) = 2*C(2) + 1 = 3
C(8) = 2*C(4) + 1 = 7
...
C(N) = N - 1

```
