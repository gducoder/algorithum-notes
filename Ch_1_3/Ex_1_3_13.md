# 1.3.13

## Problem:

Suppose that a client performs an intermixed sequence of (queue) enqueue and dequeue operations. The enqueue operations put the integers 0 through 9 in order onto the queue; the dequeue operations print out the return value. Which of the following sequence(s) could not occur?

```
a. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
b. 4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1
c. 2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0
d. 4 3 2 1 0 5 6 7 8 9
```

## Solution：

queue: FIFO.

because the input have an order which is from 0 to 9. 0 must be the first number in any sequence.

a right

b wrong

c wrong

d wrong
