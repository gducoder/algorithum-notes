# 1.3.37

## Problem:

Josephus problem. In the Josephus problem from antiquity, N people are in dire straits and agree to the following strategy to reduce the population. They arrange them- selves in a circle (at positions numbered from 0 to N–1) and proceed around the circle, eliminating every Mth person until only one person is left. Legend has it that Josephus figured out where to sit to avoid being eliminated. Write a Queue client Josephus that takes N and M from the command line and prints out the order in which people are eliminated (and thus would show Josephus where to sit in the circle).
