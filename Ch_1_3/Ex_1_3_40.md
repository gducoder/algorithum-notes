# 1.3.40

## Problem:

Move-to-front. Read in a sequence of characters from standard input and maintain the characters in a linked list with no duplicates. When you read in a previously unseen character, insert it at the front of the list. When you read in a duplicate character, delete it from the list and reinsert it at the beginning. Name your program MoveToFront: it implements the well-known move-to-front strategy, which is useful for caching, data compression, and many other applications where items that have been recently accessed are more likely to be reaccessed

## Solution：

code:

[Ex_1_3_40.java](./Ex_1_3_40.java)


linked list add find() method, return a previous of the node if node.item equals given item.
