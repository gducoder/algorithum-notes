# 1.3.12

## Problem:

Write an iterable Stack client that has a static method copy() that takes a stack of strings as argument and returns a copy of the stack. Note : This ability is a prime example of the value of having an iterator, because it allows development of such functionality without changing the basic API.

## Solution：

`Stack client` means you should not change the original api of `Stack`.

solution:

1. Stack has list iterator, it iterates from the latest added element to end.

2. If we want a copy of a stack, we should have two stacks. iterate throw the input stack, push each element into stack_1, then iterates stack_1, push each element to stack_2. Then we get the right answer.
