# 1.3.45

## Problem:

Stack generability. Suppose that we have a sequence of intermixed push and pop operations as with our test stack client, where the integers 0, 1, ..., N-1 in that order (push directives) are intermixed with N minus signs (pop directives). Devise an algorithm that determines whether the intermixed sequence causes the stack to under- flow. (You may use only an amount of space independent of N—you cannot store the integers in a data structure.) Devise a linear-time algorithm that determines whether a given permutation can be generated as output by our test client (depending on where the pop directives occur).

## Solution：

code:

[Ex_1_3_45.java](./Ex_1_3_45.java)


count the number and `-` in the input stream. If the char is a number
`count++`, else if the char is `-` , `count--`. if `count < 0` then return
`false` which means the intermixed sequence causes the stack to underflow.
