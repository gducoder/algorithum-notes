# 1.3.39

## Problem:

Ring buffer. A ring buffer, or circular queue, is a FIFO data structure of a fixed size N. It is useful for transferring data between asynchronous processes or for storing log files. When the buffer is empty, the consumer waits until data is deposited; when the buffer is full, the producer waits to deposit data. Develop an API for a RingBuffer and an implementation that uses an array representation (with circular wrap-around).

## Solution：
