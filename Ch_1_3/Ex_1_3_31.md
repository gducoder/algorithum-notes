# 1.3.31

## Problem:
Implement a nested class DoubleNode for building doubly-linked lists, where each node contains a reference to the item preceding it and the item following it in the list (null if there is no such item). Then implement static methods for the following tasks: insert at the beginning, insert at the end, remove from the beginning, remove from the end, insert before a given node, insert after a given node, and remove a given node.

## Solution：

refer to code.

note:

we should use static methods.
