# 2.4.23

## 问题：

2.4.23 Multiway heaps. Considering the cost of compares only, and assuming that it takes t compares to find the largest of t items, find the value of t that minimizes the coefficient of N lg N in the compare count when a t-ary heap is used in heapsort. First, assume a straightforward generalization of sink(); then, assume that Floyd’s method can save one compare in the inner loop.
