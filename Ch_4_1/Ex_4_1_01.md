# 4.1.01

## Problem:

What is the maximum number of edges in a graph with V vertices and no parallel edges? 

What is the minimum number of edges in a graph with V vertices, none of which are isolated?

## Solutionï¼š

```

V*(V-1)/2
for a graph, a veritex can link to v-1 vertices, and edges are bilateral,
so the maximum number of edges are v*(v-1) / 2.

V
