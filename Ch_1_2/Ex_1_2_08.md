# 1.2.08

## 问题：

Suppose that a\[\] and b\[\] are each integer arrays consisting of millions of inte- gers. What does the follow code do? Is it reasonably efficient? int\[\] t = a; a = b; b = t;

Answer. It swaps them. It could hardly be more efficient because it does so by copying references, so that it is not necessary to copy millions of elements.
