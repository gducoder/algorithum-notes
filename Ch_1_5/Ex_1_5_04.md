# 1.5.04

## Problem:

Estimate the minimum amount of time (in days) that would be required for quick-find to solve a dynamic connectivity problem with 10^9 sites and 10^6 input pairs, on a computer capable of executing 10^9 instructions per second. Assume that each iteration of the inner for loop requires 10 machine instructions.

## Solutionï¼š

input: $10^6$
union: N, $N=10^9$

$10^6 * 10^9 * 10 / 10^9  = 115.741 $ days
