# 1.5.09

## Problem:


## Solution：

```
tree looks like this:
        1
    0   3   6
        2   5
            4   9
            8 
```
The height of the tree is 5, 
however in teh weighted quick union algorithm, the height of the tree is 
$lgN$. In the example, which means that $lg10 = 4$, so the height of the tree is 4.
So is impossible that the height of tree is 5 given in the problem.
